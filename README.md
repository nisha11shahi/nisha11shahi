Hi I am Nisha Shahi from Missouri. I graduated with a Masters degree in Applied Computer Science on Spring 2020 from Southeast Missouri State University. I am currently working as an Application Developer. I am proficient in C#, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, and Python. Out of these programming languages, I feel comfortable working with ASP.NET MVC applications. In my current role, I'm working mainly with ASP.NET MVC to create web applications that worked across multiple platforms.
